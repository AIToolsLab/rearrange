## Our Project
**Vision:**
While writing, variety in vocabulary and sentence structure is vital in staving off monotony and retaining reader interest. There are always multiple ways in which a sentence can communicate the same idea yet switching between various structures can be difficult even for experience writers. We are creating a tool which can generate these various sentence alternatives to allow writers to experiment with different manners of conveying their meaning.

**Project Summary:**
We wish to expand the current existing tool created by April Volzer during her summer research project in 2020 to allow for better overall functionality and further user control over a sentence. To do this, we will continue using the same general structure employed by April Volzer in the original tool’s creation. In order to continue the goal of allowing writers to experiment with sentence restructuring we will add dragging and dropping of sentence clauses to allow easy reordering of sentences by the writer, allow choosing multiple words to replace in a sentence, and other features which enable sentence exploration. Our solution’s UI interactions and should be discover able and understandable and should be usable with minimal training. It should also provide reasonable sentence alternatives as output for a variety of sentence inputs while supporting a multitude of user manipulations on the sentence. Our tool should provide measurable qualitative and quantitative value to someone’s writing process and help with real world revision tasks.
